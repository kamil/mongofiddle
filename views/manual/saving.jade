  h2 Saving
  | Here's how you save a document to MongoDB:
  pre
    | db.scores.save({a: 99});  
  | This says, "save the document '{a: 99}' to the 'scores' collection."
  | Go ahead and try it. Then, to see if the document was saved, try
  pre
    | db.scores.find(); 
  | Once you've tried this, type 
  code next
